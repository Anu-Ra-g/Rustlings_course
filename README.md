This repo contains all my solutions to the [Rustlings course](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/). All the opinions, facts or ideas related to Rust—bad or good (according to me as a novice)—will be listed in this README. I'll be doing this course alongside the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). 


`28-06-2025`

- Completed exercises **0**, **1**, **2** and **3**
- Variables are immutable by default, has to be defined with `let` 
  and can be made mutable by declaring it with `mut`, Weird!!
- You don't have to explicity write the types as they're inferred
- Constants are not inferred, you have write the types, Super weird!!
- Main function's the entry point
- Function signature has to be defined with types
- Implicity returns are possible without the `return` keyword, Nice!!
- If statements are standard
- Ternary: `let val = if test == 23 {46} else {89};`. This is a thing

`29-06-2025`

- Completed exercises **4**, **5** and **6**
- Rust the usual primitives like `bool`, `char`, `int` etc.
- `let a = [1; 100];` is a syntax used to create an array of 100 elements
- Slices are backed by array and this is the syntax `&arr[1..4]`. Kind of like `bash`
- Has Tuples and destructing exists for tuples, arrays.
- Need to go through the Rust book a little deep 
- Vectors are dynamic arrays
- Rustlings course is not on track with the book.
